      <p class="lead mb-4">You drove to the range hoping to hit some balls and relax. Now you're pissed, nothing feels right. Try some old basic drills to get on track again:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Get your club more vertical in your backswing - do some mirror work and then feel like the club is dropping more naturally in the slot. </li>
        <li>Clock drill - feel like your hands are turning clockwise in transition. </li>
        <li>Hit balls with your driver or wedges until you get it right. Playing the really long or short clubs helps. Driver helps with rythm, wedges help with striking. </li>
        <li>Plane of glass. Keep your ass on the glass going back AND coming back through transition to help with early extension. Front hips gos straight back to meet back hip on the glass in transition. </li>
        <li>Place shaft between neck and shoulder. Make shoulder turn. Press hands all the way out. This is your backswing position. </li>
        <li>Practice pulling hands down and to the left - exxagerate it a few times. With front palm feeling like it faces downwards. Especially useful with irons. </li>
      </ul>
